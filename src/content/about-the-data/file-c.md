File C (Account Breakdown by Award) is part of the package of data submitted 
to USAspending.gov every month by federal agencies via the DATA Act Broker, 
as required by the DATA Act. It contains obligation and outlay 
data for all awards issued by a reporting agency, covering both contract 
and financial assistance awards over the lifetime of those awards. 
File C is a further breakdown of File B, showing award spending broken
down by Treasury Account Symbol (TAS), Program Activity, Object Class,
and Disaster Emergency Fund Code (DEFC, which is used to track
spending from supplemental appropriation bills addressing topics such
as COVID-19 relief and infrastructure investment)
