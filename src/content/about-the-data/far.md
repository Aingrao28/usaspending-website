The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) governs how agencies award
and execute contracts, as well as requirements for reporting contract
data publicly and exceptions to these requirements. It is a component
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Among other details, the FAR
contains the latest micro-purchase threshold that governs the minimum
amount for federal awards that must be reported ([48 CFR ยง
2.101](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/chapter-1/subchapter-A/part-2/subpart-2.1)).
